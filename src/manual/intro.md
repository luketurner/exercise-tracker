# Exercises

You create and manage your own exercises in the [Manage Exercises](/exercises) page.

Exercises can have parameters, which are used to record values associated with the exercise, like weight, distance, duration, etc. You can have more than one parameter per exercise. Parameter values can be tracked over time.
