Set is a **side project**, offered with no guarantees it will continue to work.

Don't store data in Set that you don't want to lose (or at least take advantage of the export functionality to make regular backups).

You've stumbled upon the manual for **Set** (backronym for Simple Exercise Tracker) -- a free and open-source Web app for tracking exercises over time. Using Set is a three-step process:

1. Log in with your Github account (shares your name and email with Set).
2. Create the exercises you want to track in the [Manage Exercises](/exercises) page.
3. Log your exercises in the [Today](/today) page.

# Exercises

You create and manage your own exercises in the [Manage Exercises](/exercises) page.

Exercises can have parameters, which are used to record values associated with the exercise, like weight, distance, duration, etc. You can have more than one parameter per exercise. Parameter values can be tracked over time.

| Parameter name                           | Units           | Description                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| # Reps                                   | Number          | Number of times the exercise was performed in the set.   |
| <i class="ti ti-weight"></i> Weight      | lb/kg           | Amount of weight used for the set.                       |
| <i class="ti ti-lifebuoy"></i> Assisted  | lb/kg           | Amount of assistance (negative weight) used for the set. |
| <i class="ti ti-ruler-3"></i> Distance   | mile/km         | The distance associated with the set.                    |
| <i class="ti ti-clock"></i> Duration     | min             | The duration of the set.                                 |
| <i class="ti ti-activity"></i> Intensity | Low/Medium/High | The general intensity of the set.                        |
